## 💡 Why This Plugin

Integrating sherpa-onnx into a Unity project normally requires manual native library setup, platform-specific
workarounds, and custom C# bindings. This plugin handles all of that out of the box.

### ⚡ Easy Setup

- 🔌 **One-click library install** — open Project Settings, pick a version, click Install. Native libraries for
  Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS are downloaded and configured automatically.
- 📥 **One-click model import** — paste a model URL, the importer downloads, extracts, auto-detects the model
  type, and creates a ready-to-use profile. No manual config editing.
- 🔄 **Update All** — change the version number and update every installed platform at once.

### 🔧 Platform Solutions

The plugin solves real-world platform issues that are not addressed by sherpa-onnx itself:

| Problem | Platform | What the plugin does |
|---------|----------|----------------------|
| 🔇 **Unity Microphone returns silence** | Android | Detects silence automatically, falls back to native `AudioRecord` via JNI with audio source cascade (`VOICE_RECOGNITION` → `VOICE_COMMUNICATION` → `MIC`). Disables NoiseSuppressor, AGC, and AEC that can mute the signal. Fires `SilenceDetected` event with full diagnostics. |
| 📦 **StreamingAssets locked inside APK** | Android | Extracts model files to `persistentDataPath` on first launch with version tracking and progress reporting. Skips re-extraction on subsequent launches. |
| 🌍 **Non-US locale breaks native code** | Android | Wraps native calls with a locale guard that temporarily sets `LC_NUMERIC` to `"C"`, preventing comma-as-decimal crashes in sherpa-onnx's float parsing. |
| 🍏 **No dynamic library loading** | iOS | Builds a patched `sherpa-onnx.dll` with `DllImport("__Internal")` and downloads it automatically during install. |
| ✂️ **Xcframework architecture bloat** | iOS | Filters xcframeworks to only the target architecture (device or simulator) during install. |
| 🎙️ **Microphone not actually recording** | Unity (all) | Plays a silent AudioSource on the mic clip to force the device to start recording — a known Unity workaround. |
| ⏳ **Microphone readiness delay** | Unity (all) | Polls `Microphone.GetPosition()` with a configurable timeout before starting capture. |
| 🎵 **Sample rate mismatch** | All | Built-in resampler converts any input rate to the model's expected rate (typically 16 kHz). |
| 🔐 **Microphone permission** | Android / iOS | Async permission request with `UniTask` — returns `false` gracefully if denied. |

> ⚙️ All microphone settings (silence threshold, fallback timing, diagnostics) are configurable via
> a JSON file in StreamingAssets — no code changes needed.

  ```json
  {
    "scopedRegistries": [
      {
        "name": "OpenUPM",
        "url": "https://package.openupm.com",
        "scopes": [
          "com.ponyudev.sherpa-onnx",
          "com.cysharp.unitask"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "dependencies": {
      "com.ponyudev.sherpa-onnx": "0.1.0"
    }
  }
  ```
- ✅ Unity will resolve and download the package automatically

### Option 3 - OpenUPM CLI

- 📦 Install [openupm-cli](https://openupm.com/docs/getting-started.html#installing-openupm-cli)
- ▶️ Run the command in your project folder:
  ```bash
  openupm add com.ponyudev.sherpa-onnx
  ```
- ✅ Dependencies are resolved automatically

### Option 4 - Git URL

- ⚠️ **Install UniTask first** — open **Window → Package Manager**, click **+** → **Add package from git URL...** and paste:
  ```
  https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask.git?path=src/UniTask/Assets/Plugins/UniTask
  ```
- 🔗 Then add **Sherpa-ONNX** the same way:
  ```
  https://github.com/Ponyu-dev/Unity-Sherpa-ONNX.git
  ```

## 🍏 Why the iOS Managed DLL Is Hosted Here

On desktop and Android, Unity loads native code via dynamic libraries (`.dll`, `.so`, `.dylib`).
The managed C# binding (`sherpa-onnx.dll`) uses `DllImport("sherpa-onnx-c-api")` to find them at runtime.

iOS does **not** support dynamic loading. All native code must be statically linked into the app binary.
This means the managed DLL must use `DllImport("__Internal")` instead of `"sherpa-onnx-c-api"`.

The upstream sherpa-onnx NuGet package ships with the standard `"sherpa-onnx-c-api"` binding, which does not work on iOS.
To solve this, the `Tools~/` scripts in this repository:

1. Take the official C# sources from `sherpa-onnx/scripts/dotnet/`
2. Patch `Dll.cs` to replace `"sherpa-onnx-c-api"` with `"__Internal"`
3. Build a custom `sherpa-onnx.dll` targeting `netstandard2.0`
4. Publish it as a GitHub release with tag `sherpa-v{version}`

The plugin's iOS install pipeline downloads this patched DLL automatically.

## 🏷️ Scripting Define Symbol

After installing any library, the plugin automatically adds **`SHERPA_ONNX`** to Scripting Define Symbols for all build targets. This allows you to guard runtime code that depends on sherpa-onnx:

```csharp
#if SHERPA_ONNX
    var recognizer = new OnlineRecognizer(config);
#endif
```

The define is removed automatically when all libraries are uninstalled.

## 📋 Requirements

- Unity 2022.3 or later
- `com.unity.sharp-zip-lib` 1.4.1+ (added automatically as a dependency)
